# OperationResult.Extensions

The extensions for `OperationResult` have been created for managing HTTP statuses via `OperationResult` library and converting the corresponding execution results into `ActionResults`.

Also it is possible to cast `FailureOperationResult` or `FailureOperationResult<TData>` to the indicated `FailureOperationResult<TDestination>` using the corresponding extensions.
